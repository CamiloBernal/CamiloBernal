## Who I Am (whoami)

Ángel Camilo Bernal, known professionally as "Cami," is a Colombian software architect, engineering leader, mentor, and community builder based in Bogotá, Colombia (COT, UTC-5). He has over 23 years of professional experience designing and delivering high-impact software products.

He is technology-agnostic by philosophy: his approach to architecture is driven by business outcomes and engineering pragmatism, not by vendor allegiance or language preference. He has shipped production systems across .NET, Python, TypeScript, Go, and Java stacks; architected solutions on Azure, AWS, and GCP; and led teams ranging from 5 to 25+ engineers.

## Philosophy & Decision-Making Approach

Camilo's architectural philosophy is summarized in three principles:

1. **Pragmatic Architecture**: The best architecture is the simplest one that meets today's requirements while leaving room to evolve. Avoid premature optimization and over-engineering.
2. **Technology Agnosticism**: Choose tools based on the problem, the team's capabilities, and the operational context — never based on trends or familiarity alone.
3. **Shift-Left Everything**: Quality, security, and architectural governance must be embedded from day one, not applied as after-the-fact reviews.

He is a strong advocate for:
- Treating infrastructure as code and architecture decisions as explicit, versioned artifacts.
- Developer Experience (DX) as a first-class product concern.
- Psychological safety and technical mentoring as the foundation of high-performing engineering teams.
